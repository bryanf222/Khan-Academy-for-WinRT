Khan-Academy-for-WinRT
======================

Metro Video Viewer for Khan Academy. The project was originally a [windows phone app](https://github.com/joelmartinez/Khan-Academy-for-Windows-Phone),
and this project is to separate the codebase with the aim of simplifying it. This version
will liberally use new C# features such as async/await, and avoid confusing #ifdefs.
